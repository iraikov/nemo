{#
   NMODL template for assignment equations

   This template defines an NMODL procedure called "asgns" which is
   invoked in the DERIVATIVE and the INITIAL blocks to set the values of
   the assigned quantities.

   Template variables are:

   - indent: the current indentation level
   - assignedEqLocals: a list with the names of all local variables that appear 
                       in the right-hand side of the assignment equations
   - assignedEqDefs: a list of strings with the assignment equations in NMODL syntax
#}

{% if (not (assignedEqDefs == [])) %}

PROCEDURE asgns () {
{% if (not (assignedEqLocals == [])) %}
  LOCAL {{assignedEqLocals | join (", ")}}
{% endif %}
{% for assignedEqDef in assignedEqDefs %}
  {{assignedEqDef}}

{% endfor %}

}

{% endif %}
