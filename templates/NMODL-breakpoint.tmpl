{#
   NMODL template for BREAKPOINT block

   This template defines the NMODL BREAKPOINT block which is used to compute
   the currents defined in the system.   

   Template variables are:

   - indent: the current indentation level
   - currentEqLocals: a list with the names of all local variables that appear in the rate expressions of the system
   - currentEqDefs: a list of strings with the kinetic equations in NMODL syntax
   - rateEqDefs: a list of strings with the rate equations in NMODL syntax 
                 (this is used to determine if a SOLVE statement should be generated)
   - kineticEqDefs: a list of strings with the rate equations in NMODL syntax 
                 (this is used to determine if a "SOLVE _ METHOD sparse" statement should be generated)
   - poolIons: a list of strings with the external pool ion definitions 
                     (this is used to determine if procedure "pools" should be called)
   - reactionEqDefs: a list of strings with the reaction quantities
                     (this is used to determine if procedure "reactions" should be called)
