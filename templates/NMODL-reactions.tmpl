{#
   NMODL template for reactions equations

   This template defines an NMODL procedure alled "reactions" which is
   invoked in the BREAKPOINT  the INITIAL blocks to set the values of
   the reaction states, e.g.:

   m_CaBK = mO_CaBK

   will set the reaction state 'm_CaBK' to the value of the open state
   defined for that reaction, 'mO_CaBK'. If there are more than one open
   state, then the sum of open states will be used:

   m_CaBK = mO1_CaBK + mO2_CaBK
 
   Template variables are:

   - indent: the current indentation level
   - reactionEqLocals: a list with the names of all local variables that appear 
                       in the right-hand side of the reaction equations
   - reactionEqDefs: a list of strings with the reaction equations in NMODL syntax
